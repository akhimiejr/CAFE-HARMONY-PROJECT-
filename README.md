# 1. Introduction
# CAFE-HARMONY-PROJECT-
The café specializes in offering a variety of drinks, snacks, and light meals to customers. Over the past year Café Harmony has seen impressive growth but now faces new challenges as the company is scaling to meet customer demand. The café has multiple locations across the city, each with its own performance metrics and unique customer preferences.
# 1.1 Background Information
Café Harmony has experienced rapid growth, which has led to increasing operational complexity. As a result, the café now faces challenges in maintaining efficient operations and delivering a consistently high-quality customer experience. Inefficiencies in processes, fluctuating sales performance, and moderate customer satisfaction indicate the need for improved resource management, staff performance optimization, and enhanced service strategies to support sustainable growth.

The key aims are:
1. Data Cleaning: Ensure all datasets are clean and ready for analysis.
2. Data Analysis: Use Excel formulas (like SUMIF, COUNTIF, VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH) to analyze the data.
3. Dashboarding: Create a dashboard that visually communicates the answers to the business questions using charts, pivot tables, and slicers.
4. Business Insights: Provide recommendations for business decisions based on the data insights.
   
Objective of the buisness are:
1. sales performance- outlook of the overall sales trend
2. product performance- top selling menu product generating the most revenue
3. customer demographics- customer demographic driving the highest sale
4. stock management- low running product across location
5. employee performance-  below/above average sales
6. customer feedback analysis- customer satisfaction analysis

# 2. Analysis
## 2.1 Problem Solving Techniques
To address these challenges effectively, Our team applied Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to identify the underlying sources of inefficiency, Lean Management principles to streamline operations and reduce waste, and Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM) to monitor sales trends and performance metrics. We also adopted Continuous Improvement (Kaizen) in supporting sustainability, long-term operational excellence, while Customer analysis can help refine service delivery and elevate customer satisfaction.
## 2.2 Pivot Table Analysis
The image below displays an Excel workbook transformed into a compact analytics dashboard using PivotTables, summary statistics, and visual charts to provide a comprehensive, data-driven overview of key business performance metrics for café Harmony. Several PivotTables are strategically arranged across the sheet, each focusing on different dimensions of business activities such as sales trends, product performance, customer behaviour, stock monitoring, and employee productively creating a modular structure that enables stakeholders to quickly interpret patterns and relationships within the data without needing to review raw tables.

## 2.2.1 Sales Performance
The Below Image shows aggregates total sales by month across the year, offering an insight of how revenue fluctuates throughout different periods. This enables the identification of seasonal patterns, such as peak months with high customer activity and quieter periods where sales naturally dip. By understanding these trends, the business can better assess the stability of its revenue streams and anticipate shifts in demand. These insights are valuable for making informed operational decisions, including adjusting staffing levels to match busy or slow periods, planning procurement to avoid overstocking or shortages, and designing targeted promotional strategies that align with periods of lower customer engagement or capitalise on high-traffic months.

• Total sales reached £12,589.95 across 1,003 customers.
• Monthly sales peaked at £1,220.35 in August — strong mid-year growth.
• Dip in October–November, suggesting seasonal fluctuations.
## 2.2.2 Product Performance
The image below breaks down total sales by product categories such as Cappuccino and Muffin providing a clear view of how each item contributes to overall revenue. This detailed breakdown enables the identification of both best-selling and underperforming products, allowing the business to recognise which items consistently drive sales and which may require improvement or removal. By understanding these performance differences, managers can make informed decisions on menu optimisation, adjust pricing strategies to better reflect demand, and develop targeted promotions that highlight popular items or boost interest in less frequently purchased ones. Also, this analysis offers valuable insight into broader customer demand patterns, helping the business tailor its product offerings to better meet customer preferences and enhance overall profitability.

## 2.2.3 Customer Demographics
Sales are categorised by age group such as Adults, Young Adults, and Elderly providing a clear understanding of how much revenue each demographic segment contributes to the business. This type of segmentation offers valuable insight into the spending behaviour and preferences of different age groups, enabling the business to develop more targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with specific audiences. It also supports product customisation, as the business can tailor its offerings to better suit the tastes and needs of high-value or underserved segments. Furthermore, these insights help shape customer focused service strategies, allowing the business to adjust its approach such as communication style, promotional timing, or service deliveries to enhance the overall customer experience and strengthen engagement across all demographic groups.
