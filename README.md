As a result, the café now faces challenges in maintaining efficient operations and delivering a consistently high-quality customer experience.

The key aims are:
1. Data Cleaning: Ensure all datasets are clean and ready for analysis.
2. Data Analysis: Use Excel formulas (like SUMIF, COUNTIF, VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH) to analyze the data.
3. Dashboarding: Create a dashboard that visually communicates the answers to the business questions using charts, pivot tables, and slicers.
4. Business Insights: Provide recommendations for business decisions based on the data insights.

# 2. Analysis
## 2.1 Problem Solving Techniques
To address these challenges effectively, Our team applied Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to identify the underlying sources of inefficiency, Lean Management principles to streamline operations and reduce waste, and Data-Driven Decision Making (DDDM) to monitor sales trends and performance metrics. We also adopted Continuous Improvement (Kaizen) in supporting sustainability, long-term operational excellence, while Customer analysis can help refine service delivery and elevate customer satisfaction.
## 2.2 Pivot Table Analysis
The image below displays an Excel workbook transformed into a compact analytics dashboard using PivotTables, summary statistics, and visual charts to provide a comprehensive, data-driven overview of key business performance metrics for café Harmony. Several PivotTables are strategically arranged across the sheet, each focusing on different dimensions of business activities such as sales trends, product performance, customer behaviour, stock monitoring, and employee productively creating a modular structure that enables stakeholders to quickly interpret patterns and relationships within the data without needing to review raw tables.

## 2.2.1 Sales Performance
The Below Image shows aggregates total sales by month across the year, offering an insight of how revenue fluctuates throughout different periods. This enables the identification of seasonal patterns, such as peak months with high customer activity and quieter periods where sales naturally dip. By understanding these trends, the business can better assess the stability of its revenue streams and anticipate shifts in demand. These insights are valuable for making informed operational decisions, including adjusting staffing levels to match busy or slow periods, planning procurement to avoid overstocking or shortages, and designing targeted promotional strategies that align with periods of lower customer engagement or capitalise on high-traffic months.
